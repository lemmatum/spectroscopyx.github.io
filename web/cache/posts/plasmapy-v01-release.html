<p>I address you tonight not as a programmer of Python, not as a maintainer of a
repository, but as a citizen of open source.</p>
<p>We are faced with the very newest of releases.</p>
<p>GitHub calls this one <a class="reference external" href="http://plasmapy.readthedocs.io/en/master/about/release_notes.html#version-0-1-0">PlasmaPy v0.1.0</a>, the first of the alphas.</p>
<p>And yet, for the first time in the history of this project our team has the
technology to prevent its own procrastination.</p>
<p>All of you <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/plasmapy/">pip installing</a> with us need to know that everything that could be
done to delay this release has been called into service.</p>
<p>The coder's thirst for excellence, perfectionism, every step into the abyss of
transport theory, every adventurous refactor of docs, all of our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/issues">combined ideas
for features and improvements</a>, even the code reviews that
we performed have provided us with the tools to prevent this exciting event.</p>
<p>Through all the chaos that is our Git tree, through all of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/search?q=pep8&amp;type=Commits">PEP8</a> and
the <a class="reference external" href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#plasmapy:openastronomy.org">Matrix discussion</a>,
through all the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.plasmapy.org/">pain of learning Sphinx</a> and rebasing,
through <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/commits/master">all of our ~2000 commits</a>,
there is one thing that has nourished our souls, and pushed us to complete
this release, and that is our <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/master/auto_examples/index.html">pretty plots</a>. Oh, and the
possibility to
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/en/master/atomic/decorators.html#passing-particle-instances-to-functions-and-methods">apply</a>
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/master/api/plasmapy.utils.checks.check_relativistic.html#plasmapy.utils.checks.check_relativistic">more</a>
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/master/api/plasmapy.utils.checks.check_quantity.html#plasmapy.utils.checks.check_quantity">decorators</a>.</p>
<p>The dreams of the entire PlasmaPy community are focused tonight on these <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/graphs/contributors">31
brave committers</a>,
pushing onto the master branch.</p>
<p>And may we all, plasma enthusiasts the world over, see this release through.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/master/api/plasmapy.physics.parameters.thermal_speed.html#plasmapy.physics.parameters.thermal_speed">Thermal speed</a>,
and a <span class="math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> to you,</p>
<p>~PlasmaPy</p>
